Types: by time (counting operatons), by space

Types of 0:
- O(1)
- O(log n)
- O(n)
- O(n*n)
- O(n*n*n ...)

By time:
- operations amount does not depend on n - O(1)
- yes depends (single loop example) - O(n)
- double loop - O(n*n)
...

By space:
- most primitives - O(1)
- strings - O(n)
- reference types (object, array) - O(n)

Simplify!
O(5) = O(1)
O(6n) = O(n)
O(7n*n+999n) = O(n*n)
